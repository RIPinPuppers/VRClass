# VRClass

this is a very early version of the VRClass Unity project. Later development got split into different projects due to difficulties regarding the github integration in unity (Unity Collab) and the new SteamVR 2.0. This version contains the multiplayer scenes which none of the current project versions do because the multiplayer development has been paused.

The important scene is the "Network 1" scene because it has the latest multiplayer features. To test the multiplayer, two vr stations and two build or unity projects of the game are needed. One machine cannot run two vr applications at the same time.

**To start a muliplayer game online follow these steps:**
- open the a network scene (either "Network" or "Network 1", the last one is recommended) and press play / or simply start the build
- press M or click on the Enable Match Maker button
- to start your own new server click on the "Create internet" match button after giving your server a name
- to look for other servers click on the "Find Internet Match" button (refresh the server list by exiting the listing screen and reentering)

+ Unity version 2018.2.13f1
